-- SIXDOORS EXERCICE

Context :

	This is an exercice for SIXDOORS which consists in building a web app using AngularJS in order to display informations from their REST web service.

The Web Application :

	On the main page you will have access to a list of feedEntries. Then, you can click on the photo to access to the corresponding collection.
You will have a new page with a list of feedItems.

	I developed one scenario which implements 4 tests :
		- The first one checks if the redirection works fine 
		- The second one checks that there are 2 feed entries on the main page
		- The third one checks the links sources
		- The final one checks that there is 3 feed items on the second feedEntry
